## Torn Low Ammo Warning

This script will warn you, with a flashing background on your equipped weapons on the attack page (both before you join a fight, and after it has ended), 
if your ammo drops beneath a certain threshold. The threshold is set to (clip capacity) * (num clips+1) * 3. The (num clips+1) is because it appears that 
the given number on the attack page, say "5/5 (2)" where the 5/5 is clip of 5 current, 5 max and the 2 is extra clips - not including the one already loaded.
The 'times 3' is wiggle room.
