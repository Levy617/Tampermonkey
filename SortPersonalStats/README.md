## Torn Sort Personal Stats

This simply sorts the dropdown boxes on the 'Personal Stats' page in torn, usually accesssed from the Home page. It currently defaults to alphebetically sorting, ascending. There is a checkbox to enable/disable the functionality.

Note:  If you  uncheck the checkbox to sort, you have to refresh the page, it doesn't 'unsort' back to the default, since the default isn't really sorted in any fashion to sort back to.
