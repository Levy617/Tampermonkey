## Torn Flying Availabilty

Sorry for the crappy name, may change it to "Overseas Stock Availability" or something

What it does is tell you the current inventory (available stock) of the country you are 
going to, and when that was updated. You can dynamically select the types of inventory to view.

The "last Updated" time is when the inventoy count has been updated on YATA, not when the display has updated.
